        <h3>Why is gaming my hobby?</h3>

        <p class="description"> 
            Gaming provideâ€™s a way to escape from the stresses and demands of everyday 
            life and immerse themselves in a different world. Video games can provide 
            a sense of achievement and satisfaction as players progress through levels, 
            unlock new characters, or complete objectives. They can also be a source of 
            challenge and competition, as players strive to improve their skills and 
            compete against. 
            <br>
            <br>
            However, as with any hobby, it's important to maintain a balance and make 
            sure that gaming doesn't negatively impact other aspects of my life, such 
            as work, relationships, or health.
